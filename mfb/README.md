material-floating-button
========================

Material design floating button action implementation. 

Made to be semantic, fast and easy to customize.
~~Shamelessly~~ inspired by action buttons from Google Inbox, Evernote and Path.

Please note that this is still **very beta**. Docs coming soon, in the meantime please refer to the [showcase](http://nobitagit.github.io/material-floating-button/showcase.html) for code and animations overview.
